```

It is recommended to install the mlpyqtgraph package into a virtual enviroment,
e.g. `venv`. Refer to its [refence
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more details on
its creation and usage.

After the virtual environment has been created and activated, install the
mlpyqtgraph package using e.g. `pip`:

pip install /path/to/mlpyqtgraph
```

Now, mpyqtgraph can be used whenever the appropriate virtual environment has
been activated.
